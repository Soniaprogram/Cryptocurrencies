# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

#### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Using my knowledge of Pandas, I preprocessed the dataset in order to perform PCA in Deliverable 2.

#### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Using my knowledge of how to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, I’ll reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.

#### Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Using my knowledge of the K-means algorithm, I’ll create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, I’ll run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.

#### Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
Using my knowledge of creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot, I’ll visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components I created in Deliverable 2, then I’ll create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
