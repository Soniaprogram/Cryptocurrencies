# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

#### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Using my knowledge of Pandas, I preprocessed the dataset in order to perform PCA in Deliverable 2.

#### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Using your knowledge of how to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, you’ll reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.

#### Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Using your knowledge of the K-means algorithm, you’ll create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, you’ll run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.

#### Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
Using your knowledge of creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot, you’ll visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components you created in Deliverable 2, then you’ll create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
